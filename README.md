# Overview
Pintos is a teaching operating system for x86 architectures. It is a small
operating system with all the basic functionalities of an OS developed by Stanford University.

<br>
This was an academic project done as part of the Semester 3 Operating Systems Module. As part of the 
project Threads, User Programs were implemented in this environment. Also Semaphores and Locks were 
implemented to handle concurrency issues. Also we got the oportunity to work on the Linux Operating
System as this project cannot be run on Windows or MacOS.

In Lab 1 we implemented an interactive shell as shown below.

In Lab 2 we implemented User Programs. For this we had to develop arguement passing, system calls, 
process scheduling and memory layout of the OS. To check the quality of the improvements made a set
of automated tests were run as shown below.
